OR
    One letter followed by a second letter that must be one of ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY (i.e..not I) and then followed by either one or two numbers
OR
    One letter followed by one number and then another letter
OR
    A two part post code where the first part must be One letter followed by a second letter that must be one of ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY (i.e..not I) and then followed by one number and optionally a further letter after that
    AND
    The second part must be One number followed by two letters.
```

characters.
